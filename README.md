# DataSet: Download AwA2 dataset 
https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/. This dataset consists of 37322 images of 50 animal classes with pre-extracted deep
learning features for each image.

# What is soft/hard KNN?
The name is borrowed from soft(hard)-margin SVM. soft KNN algorithm predicts one data by the distance of its nearest k data, while hard KNN predicts one by the mode label of its nearest k data.
